Nothing much to see here for now. Just a few light .dot files that I use to customize some of my working environments. I look forward to learning more. This repository will be an indicator of how much nerdery I am dabbling in; a geek barometer if you will.

It was this [github site](http://dotfiles.github.com/) that got me started with some great pointers  I hope these meager offerings help someone else. A couple of great sites I found for beginning .dot file customization are:

- [Getting Started with BASH, A Bash Tutorial](http://www.hypexr.org/bash_tutorial.php#cmd_prompt)
- [Tip: Prompt Magic, Enhancing the system prompt](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-tip-prompt/)

Have fun!
