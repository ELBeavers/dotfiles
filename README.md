Nothing much to see here for now. Just a few light .dot files that I use to customize some of my working environments. I look forward to learning more. This repository will be an indicator of how much nerdery I am dabbling in; a geek barometer if you will.

This [github dotfiles site](https://dotfiles.github.com/) kicked off my experimentation with some great pointers. I hope my meager offerings here help someone else get started.

A couple of other great sites for beginning .dot file customization are:

- [Getting Started with BASH, A Bash Tutorial](https://www.hypexr.org/bash_tutorial.php#cmd_prompt)
- [Tip: Prompt Magic, Enhancing the system prompt](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-tip-prompt/)
- [9 Enhancements to Shell and Vim Productivity](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/enhancements-to-shell-and-vim-productivity)

Have fun!
